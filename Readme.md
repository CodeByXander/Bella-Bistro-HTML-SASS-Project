## Installation

To run this project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codebyxander/Bella-Bistro-HTML-SASS-Project.git
cd Bella-Bistro-HTML-SASS-Project
```

You can now open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

This project is a static website and does not require a server or build step. Once you've cloned the repository, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern browser to view the site.

You can also explore or edit the SCSS files in the `scss` folder to customize the styles. Use a SASS compiler (like `sass` or a code editor extension) to compile the SCSS into CSS if making changes.
